    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style, hamburger recipe made from lean beef. Skip the prepackaged
        patties and take the extra time to craft up your own, and that little extra effort will be worth it. To make
        cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top with sliced cheese; continue cooking until cheese
        begins to melt.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>ground bEEf</li>
        <li>onio</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>tomayto</li>
        <li>borgir buns</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4
            teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty
            about 4 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can
            hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once,
            until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from
            grill.</li>
        <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to
            taste. Set bun tops in place.
